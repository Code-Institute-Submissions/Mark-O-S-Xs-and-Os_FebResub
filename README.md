One issue during the creation stage was that I was not able to see the game fully playing out as I expected it to. I tried changing keywords and functions around on the "script.js" file.
I managed to fix this issue by moving the whole "// Modal pop up box for the 'How to play' section" from the top of the script.js file to the bottom. After moving this, I was able to see my fully functioning code and the game finally worked.
I am still unsure as to why having the modal pop up box section in the script.js file caused the rest of the code to not work until I moved it.
